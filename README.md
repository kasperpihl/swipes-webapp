### Steps to create a build
*Don't type the `$`, playa', it's just a little extra bling* :moneybag:

1. `$ cd app-directory` Make sure you're in the right directory, dummy. :dancer: 
2. `$ git pull` Always pull latest version first
3. `$ npm install` Installs dependencies used by grunt to run its tasks and make the build
4. `$ cd app; bower install` Installs [client-side dependencies](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BcEPdbqCIAAd3b9.png) like jQuery and Backbone.js
5. `$ grunt build` Spits out a build to the public folder
